== Angels ==

Angels are a humanoid spacefaring race that’s older than most, their clear difference being their massive wings, along with their genetic propensity for unusual eye colors.  They also have quite the range of height, able to grow up to seven feet tall naturally- however it’s not infrequent to come upon one that’s around five feet.  They only occupy one planet, Sanctum. They have a reclusive society, stringent laws, technology befitting of their age-old race, and a high propensity to judge others based on their own well ingrained societal morals.  While all of this is true, it also means that they’re adept at reading others’ emotions and understanding them, and lends to wonderful organizational skills.  Should you see one on the station, it’s not uncommon to see them in positions of leadership, security, or as your psychiatrist.   They are locked in an age-old struggle with the only other race inhabiting their home system, the [[Demons]]. 

== Angel Society ==

Angel society highlights moral integrity and devotion to their borderline religious beliefs around their society’s laws.  While rates of crime and imprisonment are found lower in angel society than in any other galactic race, their law like moral code finds many individuals perpetually ostracized for what other societies may deem normal.  They also have an in depth supportive and state paid education system, teaching dedicated and mandatory classes about the importance of understanding and order.  

Sanctum’s education is highly complex and highly split into specialized fields.  Angel children often pick their chosen occupation somewhere before a human would go to high school, and usually stick with this choice for the rest of their lives.  While there are obvious problems inherent in such a system, one cannot deny that their rate of unemployment is low and that their technology is always advancing.  There are few Angels who voice complaints with their chosen vocation, but that’s not to say all enjoy their choice;  After all, idle hands are the devil’s playthings. 

Sanctum, as of current, refuses to accept any lifetime immigrants without using numerous loopholes or constantly renewing licenses.  Visits are encouraged; However, anyone of lower status visiting the planet is mandated to be accompanied by a parole officer of sorts labeled as a guardian.  Should someone be visiting on the recommendation of a particular citizen, that citizen can choose to take guardian certification courses themselves, and step in as their guardian. 

Sanctum’s populace has a high reliance on their advanced tech.  From translocators, to lasers, to nanomachines- many problems can be easily solved by their robotic workforce.  While much of this technology is a small leap ahead from the rest of the galaxy’s combined efforts, the Angels refuse to let other races even inspect it, and their tamper-proofing is also steps ahead of the galactic norm.  By law, any technology produced comes with wired in failsafe and anything not galactically available that leaves the planet must be fitted with a self-destruct.

As a result of such technology, as well as the ability to produce food and power cheaply and with little to no cost, Sanctum’s citizens often have the state cover most of their very basic needs, power, net access, water, housing, and food.  Anything luxury is typically paid for out of pocket.

== Sanctum Law ==

Sanctum’s laws are most easily understood by human society as being strangely parallel with fundamentals of Christian belief, however they have no issues with same-sex couples, and adopt equal gender roles. Public indecency, most drug use, overconsumption, promiscuity, any form of non-defensive violence, theft, and refusal to contribute to society are all punished equally in most of their forms.  Even where these offenses are too small to be rightly punished by even the most stringent judgment by law enforcement, an angel’s peers may become their jailor instead- Angels are often punished for their perceived wrongdoings by involuntarily becoming somewhat of an outcast.  Someone outed for doing immoral things will easily lose friends, social status, and potentially their job.  Luckily, their system for those unemployed is also quite sophisticated, however, it usually moves people across vast distances for a new job.  Angels tend to be quite suspicious of new people in their workplace.  

The Angels do not believe in execution, and instead, offer would-be death row prisoners another option.  They get an inexpensive probe filled with enough fuel to barely leave their solar system, a probe that’s programmed to be unable to return to Sanctum.  This is framed as the choice for a new life in exile, however, in reality, there is no choice involved.  There is only one other inhabited planet in the solar system, that of their bitter rivals, the Demons.  Some choose death in space over the only other option.

Sanctum’s ruling class is synonymous with their judicial system.  Various different courts are established across territories, with each having seven judges presiding over it, elected to their position from smaller courts.  This all moves upwards to the members of the sanctum high court of holy law, who are the de facto leaders of their race.  Judges ruling over large territories are referred to as Seraphim, and the members of the high court are referred to as Archangels.  Their election process is highly complex as a result of so many candidates shuffling around and attempting to move up, but despite this Sanctum usually has an unusually high voter turnout. 

== Angel Physiology ==

Despite having obvious similarities to humans, there are marked differences in the physiologies of Angels that set them apart from their terrestrial counterparts.  Angels are far less dense in both musculature and bone structure, leading to their ability to fly and the light gravity of their homeworld.  They have a low susceptibility to most easily visible facial flaws, such as freckles or moles, and externally their skin is almost always soft and smooth.  They don’t callous easily either. As a result of stringent genetic modification programs, most genetic disorders have been entirely wiped from the angel’s genome.   Angels tend to live about as long as Demons do, an average of about five hundred years.  

== Sanctum ==

Sanctum's atmosphere is similar to Earth's, but the gravity is significantly lighter, allowing many of the creatures that inhabit it to evolve for flight. The terrain consists of spire-like mountains, often tall enough to reach through clouds and plateaus that sport forests and other wildlife. There are two oceans, which cover a quarter of the planet's surface and many lakes. It has a population of four billion.

Sanctum shares a solar system with seven sister planets, only one inhabited by their bitter rivals, the Demons. The weather of Sanctum is a balance of sunny skies, overcasts and rain storms. Earthquakes are common, powerful ones are rare. A year lasts four hundred and seventy days, days last twenty hours, with Fourteen of sunlight.

== Language ==

Angels speak Enochian, a mess of a harmonic song that often requires years of practice to sing correctly.  It’s frequently reported by first-time listeners to be a soothing and beautiful language, many Angels singing it so deftly that you ‘can practically feel yourself getting lost in their voice’.  It’s much less pleasant when you’re learning it though.  There are many different exceptions and general inconsistencies in its structure to the point where it’s one of the more complex galactic languages. 

== Galactic Influence ==

Angels have no colonies outside of their homeworld and generally only seem to be interested in observing the rest of galactic society.  They find a place at most councils or alliance tables, frequently offering advice and support, and find the defense of their many established listening posts and observation stations from their allies.  Said listening posts comprise most of angel society’s off-world citizens and have been stationed across the galaxy since before most races developed space travel.  They collect all sorts of data, usually on the development and evolution of sentient or near-sentient life.  It is as of yet unknown why this data is being collected. 

== Demonic War ==

The Angels have been locked in an age-old struggle with their neighbors in the system, the Demons, for as long as any Angel can remember.  Old Angel texts have the segment of history determined to be both the start of the war and the entrance of Demons into the picture stricken from their records, which is curious, as no mention of the race was present during the angel’s first steps into space travel onward.  While there are large genetic similarities between angels and Demons and the only real differences coming from a plethora of specialized genetic modifications, the galactic scientific community at large still refuses to regard them as the same species. There have been a few papers published on the subject, but they’ve never passed peer review. 

The Demons have a similar, but a lower level of technology, and test Sanctum’s defenses regularly.  While the ongoing conflict doesn’t have the massive land invasions and bombings it once did, that’s only due to countermeasures in place by both sides.  It’s not uncommon to see Angel and Demon ships go missing even today, and their wreckages litter the system. 

The Demons are largely regarded as boogeymen in angel society, often looked at as lesser beings unworthy of mercy.  Some view them with pity as not being enlightened by the same structure an order that they are, but these are in the minority and are never vocal about such a thing.  This makes sense, given how starkly angel culture contrasts with their counterparts.
